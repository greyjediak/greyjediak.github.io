    <h3>Electronic Nose</h3>
      <h4>Objectives:</h4>
      <p>Develop a low cost electronic nose by interfacing six sensors to a microcontroller</p>
    <p>Read sensor data and interpret into meaningful units</p>
    <p>Provide insight into the various health conditions that breath samples uncover</p>
    <p>Current Work: Designing and building a breath acetone sensing system<br></p>
    <p>Involves PCB design, embedded programming and possibly will implement machine learning to differentiate between mixed samples.</p>
    <h3>PCB Layout Design</h3>

    <h3>Acetone Sensor Schematic With TGS1820</h3>
    <a href="assets/electronicnose/TGSPCBSchematic.png"><img src="assets/electronicnose/TGSPCBSchematic.png" Width="400" Height=400"></a>
    <p>The goal as of now is to interface the TGS sensor with the Seeed Xiao microcontroller. Since the sensor has a response time of 40s, to decrease sensor<br>
    response time, early inference will be used on the transient response. THe TGS is a MEMS hot wire sensor and the voltage difference across the constructed measuring<b>
      circuit will be used to calibrate meaningful acetone readings.
