    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Electronic Nose</h3>
      <h4>Objectives:</h4>
      <p>Develop a low cost electronic nose by interfacing six sensors to a microcontroller</p>
    <p>Read sensor data and interpret into meaningful units</p>
    <p>Provide insight into the various health conditions that breath samples uncover</p>
    <p>Current Work: Designing and building a breath acetone sensing system<br></p>
    <p>Involves PCB design, embedded programming and possibly will implement machine learning to differentiate between mixed samples.</p>
